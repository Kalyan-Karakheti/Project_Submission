pip
scrapy  --- pip install  scrapy
 (Since I was using PyCharm and scrapy wasn't installed in a direct manner firstly I install python extension package from
  https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#twisted
  since my python version was 3.8 I choose Twisted‑20.3.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl
  After this scrapy was installed
  )
